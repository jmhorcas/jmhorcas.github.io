# Summary
I am currently an **Associate Professor** in the Languages and Information Systems (LSI) area at the Department of Languages and Computer Science (LCC) of the [**University of Málaga (UMA)**](https://www.uma.es/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a position I have held since April 2025. My academic and professional career has been closely linked to UMA, where I obtained my degree in Informatics Engineering (2012) and my PhD (2018). 
My research activity began in 2012 within the [**CAOSD**](https://caosd.lcc.uma.es/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} research group, led by Professor Lidia Fuentes, where I continue to carry out my scientific work.
Before reaching my current position, I consolidated my academic career at UMA as a **Permanent Lecturer** (January 2024) and **Assistant Professor** (July 2022).
Previously, I carried out a postdoctoral specialization period at the [**University of Seville (US)**](https://www.us.es/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (2021–2022) funded by a **Juan de la Cierva–Formación** fellowship (2019 call). During this period, I joined the [**DiversoLab**](https://www.diversolab.us.es/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} research group under the supervision of Professor David Benavides.

## Scientific contributions and impact
My research activity focuses on **Software Product Lines (SPL)**, **variability management**, **configuration**, and **quality attributes**. This activity is supported by **two recognized six-year research periods (2013–2024)** and is characterized by a balance between scientific productivity and technical excellence.
I have published **more than 75 scientific works**, including:
{: style="text-align: justify"}

* **20 JCR journal articles** (13 of them in the **first quartile, Q1**).
* **38 international conference and workshop papers**.
* **17 national conference papers**.

These contributions have been recognized with **5 _Best Paper Awards_** at international conferences (SPLC'21, ConfWS'21, SoMeT'18, SPLC'17, MATES'16) and one **_Runner-up_** award (SPLC'25). In most of these works, I am the **first and corresponding author**, and I have personally presented the results at international venues. My scientific output has received **more than 800 citations** and an **h-index of 17** ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=BOtUSUwAAAAJ&hl){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}).  
A key milestone in my career was my PhD thesis, **_"WeaFQAs"_** (supervised by Lidia Fuentes and Mónica Pinto), which was awarded the **SISTEDES National Award 2020** for the best PhD thesis in Computer Science and the **Extraordinary Doctoral Award** by UMA. The results of this thesis led to **23 publications**, including top-tier JCR journals and flagship conferences, consolidating it as one of the most impactful doctoral theses at the national level in its research area.

## Projects and internationalization
I have participated in **17 competitive research projects**, including one European project, which has enabled collaboration with leading international companies such as [**Indra**](https://www.indragroup.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [**Montimage**](https://www.montimage.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and [**SCYTL**](https://www.scytl.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. My career has a strong international orientation, reinforced through research stays at **Trinity College Dublin (Ireland, 2015)** and **King's College London (UK, 2019)**, the latter resulting in publications in *IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)*.

## Service to the community
My commitment to the scientific community is reflected in my active participation in program and organizing committees of leading conferences, where I have held senior roles such as **General Chair** (ConfWS'24, ConfWS'23, MODEVAR'22) and **Local Organizer** (ConfWS'23, Modularity'16). I have also served as **Proceedings Chair** (SPLC'22, VaMoS'18), **Artifact Chair** (SPLC'24), **International Liaison and Publicity Co-Chair** (PICom'19), and have reviewed more than 50 papers for top-tier journals (TSE, JSS, ESE, IST) and conferences (SPLC, ICSR, VaMoS, Modularity, JISBD).

## Technology transfer
My technology transfer activities focus on the **development of software tools with real impact on the SPL community**, with a strong commitment to **Open Science**. I actively contribute to collaborative initiatives such as [**Flamapy**](https://flamapy.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a reference tool for the automated analysis of feature models, and [**UVLHub**](https://www.uvlhub.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, an open repository for managing and reusing [**UVL**](https://universal-variability-language.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} models, currently the de facto standard for variability modeling.
In this context, I lead the development of [**FM Fact Label**](https://fmfactlabel.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, an innovative tool for the visualization and analysis of metrics in feature models, and [**UVengine**](https://uvengine.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, an execution engine for the efficient resolution of variability in UVL models, both widely used by the research community.  
As a key antecedent, I led the development of [**vEXgine**](https://caosd.lcc.uma.es/vexgine/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a registered tool supporting the CVL language and the core artifact of my PhD thesis. Its impact was recognized with the **Young Best Tool Award** at **SPLC'17**, sponsored by [**Hitachi**](https://www.hitachi.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, leading to long-term collaborations with the [**University of A Coruña (UDC)**](https://lbd.udc.es/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and the company **Enxenio**(https://www.enxenio.es/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, as part of the national [**TASOVA**](https://tasovaplus.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} network.

## Teaching and mentoring
I have **one recognized teaching period (quinquennium)**, and teaching experience at both the UMA and the US, as well as participation in educational innovation projects.
I have supervised **9 Bachelor's theses and 6 Master's theses**, and I am currently co-supervising a PhD thesis in collaboration with the [**UNED**](https://www.uned.es/universidad/docentes/informatica/ruben-heradio-gil.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
